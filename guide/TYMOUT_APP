Based on the detailed document provided by the client for the "tymout" web application, here are the **core technical features** required to successfully launch this full-stack, mobile-first web application with a microservices architecture (without Docker). The application aims to combat urban loneliness by fostering authentic, interest-based, real-life connections through meetups and events. It will initially be a web application to test the concept before expanding to a mobile app, requiring a robust and scalable technical foundation. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the essential features needed:

---

### **1. Microservices Architecture**
The application will leverage a microservices-based architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and independent development of features. Each microservice will handle a specific functionality and communicate with others without relying on Docker for containerization. The key microservices include:

- **User Service**  
  - Functionality: User registration, authentication, profile creation (interests, hobbies, bio), and verification (e.g., ID checks via Aadhaar or similar).
  - Tech Considerations: RESTful API endpoints, secure password hashing, session management.

- **Event Service**  
  - Functionality: Creation, updating, and deletion of events ("tables") with details like topic, location, time, dress code, and optional entry fees.
  - Tech Considerations: CRUD operations, event scheduling logic.

- **Discovery Service**  
  - Functionality: Search and filter events based on location, interests, or host reputation.
  - Tech Considerations: Advanced querying capabilities, caching for performance.

- **Request Service**  
  - Functionality: Manage user requests to join events, including host approval/rejection workflows.
  - Tech Considerations: State management for request statuses, real-time updates.

- **Notification Service**  
  - Functionality: Send real-time notifications (e.g., event updates, request approvals, reminders) via email, SMS, or in-app alerts.
  - Tech Considerations: Integration with messaging queues (e.g., RabbitMQ) or push notification services.

- **Feedback Service**  
  - Functionality: Collect and manage post-event ratings and reviews for users and hosts.
  - Tech Considerations: Flexible schema for qualitative and quantitative feedback.

- **Safety Service**  
  - Functionality: Implement safety features like optional real-time location sharing and a panic button for emergencies.
  - Tech Considerations: Geolocation APIs, emergency response integration.

- **Payment Service**  
  - Functionality: Handle monetization features such as premium subscriptions, event fees, or revenue sharing with partners.
  - Tech Considerations: Integration with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay), transaction security.

- **Partnership Service**  
  - Functionality: Manage relationships with local businesses (e.g., cafes) for venue listings and partnership agreements.
  - Tech Considerations: API for partner onboarding, revenue-sharing logic.

### **2. Mobile-First Frontend**
The web application must prioritize mobile usability while remaining functional on desktops, aligning with the client's mobile-first directive.

- **Framework**: Use a modern JavaScript framework like React, Vue.js, or Angular for a responsive, single-page application (SPA).
- **Features**:
  - Intuitive UI for browsing events, creating/joining tables, and managing profiles.
  - Responsive design with CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap) optimized for mobile screens.
  - Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities (e.g., offline mode, push notifications) to enhance mobile experience and prepare for future mobile app transition.
- **UX Considerations**: Smooth navigation, fast load times, and accessibility compliance (e.g., WCAG standards).

---

### **3. Backend Development**
Each microservice will have its own backend logic, tailored to its specific needs, ensuring flexibility and performance.

- **Languages/Frameworks**:
  - Node.js with Express for I/O-heavy services (e.g., Notification, Request).
  - Python with Flask/Django for computation-heavy services (e.g., Discovery, Feedback).
- **API Gateway**: A centralized entry point (e.g., built with Express or Nginx) to route frontend requests to appropriate microservices.
- **Inter-Service Communication**: RESTful APIs for simplicity or gRPC for high-performance needs; message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous tasks like notifications.

---

### **4. Database Management**
Each microservice will use a database suited to its data requirements, supporting the distributed nature of the architecture.

- **User Service**: PostgreSQL (relational) for structured user data and relationships.
- **Event Service**: PostgreSQL for event details and scheduling consistency.
- **Discovery Service**: Elasticsearch for fast, search-optimized event querying.
- **Feedback Service**: MongoDB (NoSQL) for flexible storage of reviews and ratings.
- **Safety/Payment/Partnership Services**: Combination of relational (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) based on specific needs (e.g., transactions vs. logs).
- **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency across services using event-driven patterns (e.g., publishing updates via message queues).

---

### **5. Authentication and Authorization**
Security is critical for user trust and data protection.

- **Centralized Authentication**: Implement a dedicated service using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth 2.0 for secure user login and API access.
- **Role-Based Access**: Differentiate permissions for users, hosts, and admins (e.g., hosts can moderate, admins can manage partnerships).
- **Verification**: Integrate with external services (e.g., Aadhaar API in India) for identity checks, adding a verification badge to profiles.

---

### **6. Safety and Security Features**
Given the real-world meetup focus, safety is a priority.

- **User Verification**: ID, photo, and mobile number validation to ensure authenticity.
- **Real-Time Safety Tools**: Optional location sharing (via browser geolocation API) and a panic button linked to emergency contacts or local authorities.
- **Data Security**: Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., user info, payment details) in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (database encryption).

---

### **7. Scalability and Performance**
The microservices architecture inherently supports scalability, but specific mechanisms are needed without Docker.

- **Independent Scaling**: Deploy each microservice on separate virtual machines (e.g., AWS EC2) or serverless platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda), scaling based on demand (e.g., Discovery Service during peak browsing).
- **Load Balancing**: Use a load balancer (e.g., Nginx, AWS ELB) to distribute traffic across service instances.
- **Caching**: Implement Redis or Memcached for frequently accessed data (e.g., event listings).

---

### **8. Monitoring and Logging**
Maintaining application health and troubleshooting issues require robust observability.

- **Centralized Logging**: Use the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to aggregate logs from all microservices.
- **Monitoring**: Deploy Prometheus and Grafana to track performance metrics (e.g., response times, error rates) and set alerts for anomalies.

---

### **9. Deployment and Infrastructure**
Without Docker, deployment will rely on traditional or cloud-native approaches.

- **Cloud Hosting**: Use a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) with virtual machines for each microservice.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate builds, testing, and deployment using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
- **Orchestration Alternative**: While Kubernetes typically uses Docker, a lightweight alternative like Nomad or manual server management could orchestrate services if needed.

---

### **10. Testing Strategy**
A comprehensive testing approach ensures reliability and quality.

- **Unit Testing**: Test individual microservice components (e.g., API endpoints, business logic).
- **Integration Testing**: Verify interactions between microservices (e.g., User Service notifying Notification Service).
- **End-to-End Testing**: Simulate user journeys (e.g., profile creation to event attendance) using tools like Cypress or Selenium.
