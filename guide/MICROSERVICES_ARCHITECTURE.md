### Key Components

1. **API Gateway**: Central entry point that routes requests to appropriate services
2. **Microservices**: Independent, domain-specific services
3. **Databases**: Each service has its own database (or schema)
4. **Message Broker**: For asynchronous communication between services (optional)
5. **Service Registry**: For service discovery (optional)

## Technology Stack

### Recommended Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Node.js, Python, Java, C#, Go (choose based on team expertise)
- **API Gateway**: Express.js (Node.js), Spring Cloud Gateway (Java), Nginx
- **Database**: MongoDB (as per existing connection string), PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka (for asynchronous communication)
- **Service Registry**: Consul, etcd, or configuration-based approach
- **Process Management**: PM2 (for Node.js), Supervisor (for Python), systemd (Linux)

## Service Breakdown

### Core Services

1. **Authentication Service**
   - Responsibility: User authentication, authorization, token management
   - Endpoints: `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/verify`, etc.
   - Database: User credentials, tokens

2. **User Service**
   - Responsibility: User profile management
   - Endpoints: `/users/{id}`, `/users/profile`, etc.
   - Database: User profiles, preferences

3. **Product Service**
   - Responsibility: Product catalog management
   - Endpoints: `/products`, `/products/{id}`, `/products/categories`, etc.
   - Database: Products, categories, inventory

4. **Order Service**
   - Responsibility: Order processing and management
   - Endpoints: `/orders`, `/orders/{id}`, `/orders/history`, etc.
   - Database: Orders, order items, order status

5. **Payment Service**
   - Responsibility: Payment processing
   - Endpoints: `/payments`, `/payments/methods`, `/payments/process`, etc.
   - Database: Payment records, payment methods

### Supporting Services

1. **Notification Service**
   - Responsibility: Sending emails, SMS, push notifications
   - Communication: Typically event-based via message broker

2. **Reporting Service**
   - Responsibility: Generating reports, analytics
   - Database: Read-only replicas or data warehouse

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication

- **REST APIs**: Primary method for service-to-service communication
  - Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Implement proper status codes and error handling
  - Document APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger

- **gRPC** (optional for performance-critical paths)
  - Faster than REST due to binary serialization
  - Requires more setup and tooling

### Asynchronous Communication

- **Event-Driven Architecture**
  - Services publish events to a message broker
  - Interested services subscribe to relevant events
  - Improves decoupling and resilience

- **Message Broker Setup**
  - RabbitMQ: Simpler to set up, good for most use cases
  - Kafka: Better for high-volume, event sourcing scenarios

## Database Strategy

### Database Per Service

- Each microservice has its own database instance or schema
- Ensures loose coupling and independent scaling
- Prevents one service from impacting another's data

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Connection Management**
   - Use connection pooling
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Handle connection failures gracefully

2. **Data Consistency**
   - Implement eventual consistency where appropriate
   - Use saga pattern for distributed transactions
   - Consider CQRS for complex read/write scenarios

3. **MongoDB Specific**
   - Use the provided connection string: `mongodb+srv://tymout:xShiTOyopWJvVYWn@tymout.2ovsdf2.mongodb.net/`
   - Create separate databases for each service
   - Implement proper indexes for performance

## Deployment Strategy

### Process-Based Deployment

1. **Service Setup**
   - Each service runs as an independent process
   - Assign unique ports to each service
   - Use process managers to ensure availability

2. **Process Management Tools**
   - **PM2** (for Node.js services)
     ```bash
     # Install PM2
     npm install pm2 -g
     
     # Start a service
     pm2 start service.js --name "auth-service"
     
     # Monitor services
     pm2 monit
     
     # Setup startup script
     pm2 startup
     ```

   - **Systemd** (for Linux environments)
     ```bash
     # Create service file
     sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/auth-service.service
     
     # Example service file content
     [Unit]
     Description=Authentication Service
     After=network.target
     
     [Service]
     User=appuser
     WorkingDirectory=/opt/services/auth-service
     ExecStart=/usr/bin/node server.js
     Restart=always
     
     [Install]
     WantedBy=multi-user.target
     
     # Enable and start service
     sudo systemctl enable auth-service
     sudo systemctl start auth-service
     ```

3. **Windows Services** (for Windows environments)
   - Use NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager) to create Windows services
   - Or use Windows Task Scheduler for simpler setups

### Load Balancing

1. **Nginx as Reverse Proxy**
   ```nginx
   # Example Nginx configuration
   http {
     upstream auth_service {
       server 127.0.0.1:3001;
       # Add more servers for scaling
     }
     
     upstream user_service {
       server 127.0.0.1:3002;
     }
     
     server {
       listen 80;
       
       location /api/auth/ {
         proxy_pass http://auth_service/;
       }
       
       location /api/users/ {
         proxy_pass http://user_service/;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Application-Level Load Balancing**
   - Implement in API Gateway
   - Use round-robin or other load balancing algorithms

## Service Discovery

### Configuration-Based Approach

- Simplest approach for smaller systems
- Maintain a configuration file with service endpoints
- Update configuration when endpoints change

```json
{
  "services": {
    "auth-service": "http://localhost:3001",
    "user-service": "http://localhost:3002",
    "product-service": "http://localhost:3003",
    "order-service": "http://localhost:3004",
    "payment-service": "http://localhost:3005"
  }
}
```

### Service Registry (for larger systems)

1. **Consul**
   - Services register themselves with Consul
   - API Gateway queries Consul for service locations
   - Provides health checking capabilities

2. **etcd**
   - Distributed key-value store
   - Services register their endpoints
   - Clients query for service information

## Monitoring and Logging

### Centralized Logging

1. **ELK Stack**
   - Elasticsearch: Log storage and search
   - Logstash: Log processing
   - Kibana: Visualization

2. **Implementation**
   - Use logging libraries in each service
   - Forward logs to centralized server
   - Implement structured logging (JSON format)

### Monitoring

1. **Health Checks**
   - Implement `/health` endpoint in each service
   - Check dependencies (database, external services)
   - Return detailed health status

2. **Metrics Collection**
   - Use Prometheus for metrics collection
   - Monitor CPU, memory, request rates, error rates
   - Set up alerts for critical thresholds

3. **Distributed Tracing**
   - Implement request IDs across services
   - Use tools like Jaeger or Zipkin for complex systems

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization

1. **JWT-Based Authentication**
   - Auth service issues JWTs
   - Other services validate tokens
   - Include necessary claims (user ID, roles)

2. **API Keys for Service-to-Service**
   - Use API keys for service-to-service communication
   - Rotate keys regularly

### Network Security

1. **Internal Network**
   - Keep services in private network when possible
   - Only expose API Gateway to public

2. **HTTPS**
   - Use HTTPS for all external communication
   - Consider HTTPS for internal communication in production

### Data Security

1. **Encryption**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use HTTPS for data in transit

2. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all inputs at service boundaries
   - Implement rate limiting

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

1. **Service Setup**
   - Run each service locally on different ports
   - Use environment variables for configuration

2. **Development Tools**
   - Use Postman/Insomnia for API testing
   - Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests

### Continuous Integration

1. **Build Pipeline**
   - Automate testing for each service
   - Enforce code quality standards

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Automate deployment to staging/production
   - Implement blue-green or canary deployments

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling

1. **Process Replication**
   - Run multiple instances of each service
   - Use load balancer to distribute traffic

2. **Database Scaling**
   - Implement read replicas for read-heavy services
   - Consider sharding for write-heavy services

### Vertical Scaling

1. **Resource Allocation**
   - Allocate more resources to critical services
   - Monitor resource usage to identify bottlenecks

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Optimize database queries

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building a microservices-based application without Docker. It balances the benefits of microservices (scalability, maintainability, resilience) with the simplicity of process-based deployment.

As the application grows, you can gradually introduce more advanced patterns and tools, or even transition to containerization if needed.
